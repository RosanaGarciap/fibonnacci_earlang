# Fibonacci Sequence with Earlang
# Overview
Something we here as programmers is the great work "specializing" and usually when you specialize in something you lost opportunity to see and learn new alternatives about how to solve the same kind of problems. Maybe you have always worked with OOP (Object Oriented Programming), using mostly Python, Java and ther OPP programming languages, however, even if you are just starting with a OOP language or have many years specializing on it, you will find useful dedicate sometime to understand Erlang. Erlang is a functional programming language similar to Haskell, but what makes Erlang so interesting is how processes manipulation require strictly each function or process acts as an independent body who can only interact with others by passing messages (or values) to each other. [Every communication is explicit, traceable and safe](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/introduction#what-is-erlang).

The purpose of this repository is provide you an easy starting point to learn of how to write, compile and run Erlang programs by providing you a working solution for one of the most common excercises when studyig recurssion, the Fibonacci Sequence.

# Development Environment

Editor: Visual studio Code
Programming Language: Earlang/OTP 27.4
Libraries: OTP 

Note: OTP is the default set of libraries used by Earlang to work and is downloaded with the installation of the language.

# Future Work
According to some resources there are more optimal variables for list concatenation that allows manipulate list data decreasing the risk for errors.
Future versions of Fibonacci function could include diferent methods for concatenate and print lists, or use tuples to learn how to work diferent structures.
