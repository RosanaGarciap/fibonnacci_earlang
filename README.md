# Fibonacci Sequence with Earlang
# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description for the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Erlang language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Editor: Visual studio Code
Programming Language: Earlang/OTP 27.4
Libraries: OTP 

Note: OTP is the default set of libraries used by Earlang to work and is downloaded with the installation of the language.

# Future Work
According to some resources there are more optimal variables for list concatenation that allows manipulate list data decreasing the risk for errors.
Future versions of Fibonacci function could include diferent methods for concatenate and print lists, or use tuples to learn how to work diferent structures.
